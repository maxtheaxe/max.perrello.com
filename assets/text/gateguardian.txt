I'm the first to encourage people to make a few bucks where they can, especially if they're helping educate people for a good cause, but
it's not okay when people who have no idea what they're talking about, claim to, and try make money off of that.

Let's look at the blurb about Signal as an example:

"...Signal is pretty much a more open-sourced Telegram clone..."

• First of all, as the successor to Red Phone and TextSecure, Signal was effectively created (in its early form) in 2010, while Pavel
Durov (one of the founders of Telegram) was still well-entrenched as the CEO of VKontakte.

• Second of all, calling Signal a Telegram clone is grossly disrespectful to the technology behind the former (Signal), as Signal's
encryption protocol (the "Signal Protocol") is open source and well-vetted by the security community. On the other hand, Telegram uses a
closed source protocol ("MTProto") that, as far as I understand it, is worse (don't forget that by default, Telegram doesn't use 
end-to-end encryption). Read more about it here, from people who actually know what they're talking about:

• Third, this doesn't even mention the general sketchiness behind Telegram's creation. Read about that here:

Also, one of their other mentions, KIK, is in the process of being shut down. One Google search would've turned this up, and as this
article was posted today, it's clear the author didn't do any research. 

I didn't even bother reading the other blurbs, there are better ways to waste my time.
GateGuardian claims to be "your cyber privacy protector," but that's kinda tough to do if they have no idea what they're talking about.

This kind of misinformation, even if not malicious, is really, really dangerous (for a plethora of reasons).
